# Car Library

Created by Noah G, Ethan J, 

## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, CarDex is for car enthusiasts. It allows users to look at any car that they wish; view its stats and see its prices. This is a fairly large database of vehicles as nuanced as differences in year, model and make.

## API & React Router

This application will use the [name of API] API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

- Link to API documentation: [https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/]

-/vehicles/GetAllManufacturers?ManufacturerType=Intermediate&page=2
  -fetches all car manufacturers

-/vehicles/GetMakesForManufacturerAndYear/mer?year=2013&format=json
  -fetches car makes for manufacturers by the year

-/vehicles/GetModelsForMake/honda?format=json
  -fetches car models for make

[If your API requires an API key, say so here.] No


## üë©‚Äçüíª MVP User Stories & Frontend Routes

The application will feature the following frontend routes and core features:

* On the `/manufacturers` page, users can view car manufacturers
* On the `/models` page, users can view models of the vehicles
* On the `/makes` page, users can view makes of the vehicles


## ü§î Stretch User Stories

If time permits, the following stretch features will be implemented in order of priority:

* Users will be able to view performance data on the car (horsepower & 0-60)
* Users will be able to see car prices.
* Users will be able to favorite the cars they look at and save them for later.
